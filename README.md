# Django_API_comments

## Overview of Assignment
Build a CRUD REST API using Django Rest Framework.

A PostgreSQL database was used for this API.

<strong><u>GET Endpoint </strong></u> -  Get a comment by it's id and retrieve all subsequent replies.

<strong><u>POST Endpoint </strong></u> -  Save a new comment. id is not required in the body of the request because the id is automatically generated by Django.

<strong><u>PUT Endpoint </strong></u> -  Edit the text for a single comment identified by it's id in the request body.

<strong><u>Delete Endpoint </strong></u> -  Delete an existing comment based on it's id in the request body.

** All endpoints other than the GET endpoint requires the username and password of a registered user for basic authentication before the logic of the endpoint is executed.

### Comment Model
<ul>
    <li> An unique id (autogenerated by Django)
    <li> The Comment text body
    <li> The date and time the comment was created (autogenerated by Django)
    <li> The Comment owner id (id of the user who posted the comment)
    <li> The id of the parent comment. Set to 0 when there is no parent comment before this comment.
</ul>
